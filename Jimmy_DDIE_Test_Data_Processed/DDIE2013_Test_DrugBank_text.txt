food interaction: oral administration of drug    tablets with food does not significantly lower the rate or extent of drug absorption relative to the fasted state.
however, the extent of biotransformation of drug to the active metabolite, drugat, is reduced approximately 43%, resulting in a reduction in the plasma ace inhibition curve of approximately 20%, probably clinically insignificant.

drug-drug interactions: the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drug capsules and other drug have not been determined.
however, interactions may be expected and drug capsules should not be used in combination with other drug.
the pharmacokinetic interaction between drug and drug capsules was investigated.
therefore, drug capsules should be used with caution in combination with drug, particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg.
results from limited in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction studies between drug and drug are inconclusive.
therefore, caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of drug and drug capsules.
